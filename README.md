# Knapsack Problem solver with top-down and bottom-up approaches

This repo contains two classic dynamic programming implementations of the 0/1 Knapsack Problem:
- Top-down (recursive with memoization)
- Bottom-up (iterative with tabulation)

The goal is to select the most valuable combination of items without exceeding the weight capacity of the knapsack.

## What is the Knapsack Problem?

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the most valuable subset of items that fits within a fixed weight capacity.

## Features

- Clean object-oriented structure for items
- Memoization with decorators for top-down approach
- Full decision matrix for bottom-up approach
- Example items taken from the Lord of the Rings:)
